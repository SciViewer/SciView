# SciView

SciView offers a dataset and tools for intuitively managing, exploring and navigating millions of publications with your own hardware.

## About

It is generally known that hundred thousands of scientific articles get written every year in an almost exponential manner. Through this overabundance of information todays students/scienticsts and professionals have to rely on various search and meta search tools in order to navigate this sea of publications. Just to name a few of those tools:

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
* [Microsoft Academic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/)
* [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
* [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/)
* [Iris AI](https://iris.ai/)
* [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/)

The general services offered by the listed websites revolve mostly around offering a search framework or a knowledge database which allows a user to find the information he/she is looking for. While it is great to have an abundance of search tools in order to find the publication of interest, one subsequently works with just a small amount of publications in an everyday research process. Not exceeding working with a managaneable amount of publications is bound by what a researcher can read and process. Therefore being aware of new scientific publication in the field of interest is doable, as long as the amount of publications specific to this field can be found and read in a reasoanable amount of time. 

Now we reach a point in which a researcher has to screen and compare a multitude of publications, of the exeeding the amount one can read and process, in order to make sure the information of interest can or can not be found. So there is a discrepancy on how a reasercher currently processes scientific publications, on one hand a multitude of publications and its content should be screened and on the other a researcher still can only read a small subset of publications. So were are the tools to screen the full text of hundreds, thousands or millions of publications in order to get the information of interest?

Of course the screening of information at this scale is limitited by several factors. Just to name some of them:
* Lack of access to millions of publications and its full text
* Need of transformation into a machine readable format
* No widespread use of accessible textmining and NLP applications

Now due to expanding need of screening scientific publications without being able to process them by reading I claim that we will see a paradigm shift in the near future towards the following points:
* Full text content will be readily available in a machine processeable format
* Publications and content will be avaialable as aggregated and annotated datasets for textmining purposes
* New services and applications for applying textmining frameworks on self aggregated datasets will emerge
* Open access will expand and the business practises of today's established journals will adapt accordingly

With SciView I want to work along those paradigms and find out how the handling and processing of scientific publications and material can look like in the future.

## Personal goals and interest
I want to present workflows and tools in order to aggreagate a dataset containing full text of millions of publications, annotad with corresponding meta data. This data set allows subsequently the screening of millions of publications with the goal of giving reasearchers a way to process the ever increasing amount of scientific articles in a reasonable manner not bound to any online service.

But what I prioritized above everything was that the project is done without any monetary or oppoertunity gain in the future, I simply wanted to follow my interest of processing text from scientific articles and see if I can handle terabytes of data with easily accessible hardware. Therefore most content of the repository and blog have been created with the paradigm of function over form, this means that robustness, testing, optimization is thrown out the window, in exchange for getting working code in fast and efficient manner.

## The Repository
The [SciView](https://github.com/SebastianVonRotz/SciView) repository is of course the main part of this project and further information can of course be found on the repository itself.
