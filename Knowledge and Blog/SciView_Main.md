It is generally known that hundred thousands of scientific articles get written every year in an almost exponential manner. Through this overabundance of information todays students/scienticsts and professionals have to rely on various search and meta search tool in order to navigate this sea of publications. Just to name a few:

* Google Scholar https://scholar.google.com/
* Microsoft Academic https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic/
* Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org/
* Research Gate https://www.researchgate.net/
* Iris AI https://iris.ai/
* Open Knowledge Maps https://openknowledgemaps.org/

The general services offered by the listed websites revolve mostly around offering a search framework or a knowledge database which allows a user to find the information he/she is looking for. While it is great to have an abundance of search tools in order to find the publication of interest, one subsequently works with just a small amount of publications in an everyday research process. Not exceeding working with a managaneable amount of publications is bound by what a researcher can read and process. Therefore being aware of new scientific publication in the field of interest is doable as long as the amount of publications specific to this field can be found and read in a reasoanable amount of time. 

Now we reach a point in which a researcher has to screen and compare multiple publications in order to make sure the information of interest can or can not be found. So there is a discrepancy on how a reasercher currently processes scientific publications, on one hand a multitude of publications and its content should be screened and on the other a researcher still can only read a small subset of publications. So were are the tools to screen the fulltext of hundreds, thousands or millions of publications in order to get the information of interest?

Of course the screening of informatio


Lack of access to millions of publications and its full text
Need of transformation into a readable format
Lack of easily accessible textmining and NLP applications

Expected paradigm shift

* Full text content has to be readily available in a machine proceasable format
* Huge amounts of data should be easy to download
* Open access will expand

As mentioned above today we get flooded with new publications but there are only tools for searching a small amount of publications but not process a large amount. This is further highlighted by that most search engines work with the abstract, title and keywords instead of the full content and therfore still forcing the reader to get hands on the full content often through paywalls, subscriptions and other hurdles.

## Personal goals and interest

With this project I want to present workflows and tools in order to aggreagate a dataset containing full text of millions of publications, annotad with corresponding meta data. This data set allows subsequently the screening of millions of publications with the goal of giving reasearchers a way to process the ever increasing amount of scientific articles in a reasonable manner not bound to any online service.

But what I prioritized above everything was that the project is done without any monetary or oppoertunity gain in the future, I simply wanted to follow my interest of processing text from scientific articles and see if I can handle terabytes of data with easily accessible hardware. Therefore most content of the repository and blog have been created with function over form, this means that robustness, testing, optimization is thrown out the window, if the code does its job I use it.

## The Repository


## Blog Posts
With the blog I aim to do two things. First I want to write about something and second I want to share learnings beyond the content of the repository.

### SciView Part 1 - Data Storage with a Synology NAS (100%)

### SciView Part 2 - Data processing with Unix (From Torrent to Text) (10%)

### SciView Part 3 - Parallel text preprocessing for NLP applications with Python (0%)

### SciView Part 4 - Meta data reference databases (0%)
